# RRT with multiple remote goals.

This repository contains the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) package with code implementation of RRT-based path planning algorithm suitable for exploration of a trackdrive circuit according to the rules of Formula Student Driverless [competition](https://www.formulastudent.de/fsg/) in Germany. This algorithm is based on my contribution to [E-gnition](https://www.egnition.hamburg/), a FS Team of Technical University Hamburg.

A brief introduction to the main steps of the proposed algorithm is given in my Master's thesis presentation [(direct timestamp)](https://youtu.be/eOevF5jFSoc?t=475).

### Notes
- The algorithm does not utilize the cones' color information, but instead a simple logic is used, which rewards the branches with cones from both sides (see findBestBranch(...) method), and penalizes the branches having cones only from one side. With cone classification information a better rating system can be implemented and applied.
- Unfortunately I wasn't able to test and see this algorithm working on real hardware, a FS Driverless car, so I am excited if you can bring it the reality on any mobile robot and share some videos with me (see section **Usage**)

### Usage
- Exploration of [FSG'18 trackdrive circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjssdifs0DQ) in Gazebo.
- Exploration of [FSG'17 trackdrive circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJAjrCig3yE) in Gazebo.
